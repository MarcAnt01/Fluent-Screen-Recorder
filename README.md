This app is FOSS, meaning it's free and open source software, no money is made out of it, for this reason donations are really appreciated to keep me motivated to work on the app.


### License

The main app uses [MIT License](https://github.com/MarcAnt01/Fluent-Screen-Recorder/blob/master/LICENSE), but the internal audio library is licensed under [LGPL](https://github.com/MarcAnt01/Fluent-Screen-Recorder/blob/3.0/ScreenSenderComponent/LICENSE)
